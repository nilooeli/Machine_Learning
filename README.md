## Supervised Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on project using **supervised learning** algorithms in Python. Each project demonstrates key concepts in **clasification** and **regression**, using scikit-learn and real-world or built-in datasets. The notebooks are designed for learning, exploration, and visualization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/nilooeli/Supervised_Learning.git
   cd Supervised_Learning/supervised_algorithms

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors Classification - Handwritten Digits

*Notebook:* [knn_digits.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/knn_digits.ipynb)

*Description:* This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately predict digit labels based on pixel data.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression - California Housing

*Notebook:* [knn_regression.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/knn_regression.ipynb)

*Description:* This project applies the KNN regression technique to predict California housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and demographics.

### 3. Regression Model Comparison

*Notebook:* [regression_models_comparison.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/regression_models_comparison.ipynb)

*Description:* This project compares Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Elasticnet regression models to understand their performance differences. It provides insights into regularization techniques and their impact on model accuracy. Includes side-by-side results for easy comparison.

### 4. Logistic Regression Classification

*Notebook:* [logistic_regression_classification.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/logistic_regression_classification.ipynb)

*Description:* This project employs logistic regression to perform binary classification tasks. It demonstrates the application of logistic regression on a chosen dataset to predict categorical outcomes.

### 5. Linear SVM Classification

*Notebook:* [linear_svm_banknote_classification.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/linear_svm_banknote_classification.ipynb)

*Description:* This project demonstrate how to use a **Linear Support Vector Machine(SVM)** to classify banknotes as **authentic or forged** using the [UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).

### 6. Naive Bayes Classification

*Notebook:* [Naive_Bayes_Classification.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/Naive_Bayes_Classification.ipynb)

*Description:* This project demonstrates the implementation of the Naive Bayes classification algorithm using the Gaussian algorithm. This notebook includes data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
