## Supervised Learning Projects
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects focused on **supervised learning"" using python and scikit-learn.
It includes implementation of classification models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
## KNN Digit Classifier
- Description: Classifies handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and scikit-learn 'digits' dataset. It includes a Jupyter notebook for visualization, training, and evaluation.
- Highlights:
  - Visualizes digit samples
  - Train and evaluates a KNN model
  - Displays confusion matrix
  - Achieves ~98.7% accuracy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: Opent the notebook file using Jupyter: `jupyter notebook notebooks/knn_digit_classifier.ipynb`

## Future Improvements
- Use PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
