## Supervised Learning Projects

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors Classification - Handwritten Digits

*Notebook:* [knn_digits.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/knn_digits.ipynb)

*Description:* This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately predict digit labels based on pixel data.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression - California Housing

*Notebook:* [knn_regression.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/knn_regression.ipynb)

*Description:* This project applies the KNN regression technique to predict California housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and demographics.

### 3. Regression Model Comparison

*Notebook:* [regression_models_comparison.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/regression_models_comparison.ipynb)

*Description:* This project compares Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Elasticnet regression models to understand their performance differences. It provides insights into regularization techniques and their impact on model accuracy. Includes side-by-side results for easy comparison.

### 4. Logistic Regression Classification

*Notebook:* [logistic_regression_classification.ipynb](supervised_algorithms/logistic_regression_classification.ipynb)

*Description:* This project employs logistic regression to perform binary classification tasks. It demonstrates the application of logistic regression on a chosen dataset to predict categorical outcomes.
